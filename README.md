# Teamspeak5-OBS-Overlay

This is an overlay for OBS to show the current talking clients in your Teamspeak 5 Channel.  
This App uses the new "Remote Apps" feature of Teamspeak 5.

This overlay uses the [Teamspeak 5 Remote App API](https://github.com/DerTyp7/react-ts5-remote-app-api).

4. Start adding parameters like discribed in [Adding Parameters](#adding-parameters)

### Adding Parameters

Start by adding a `?` to the end of the URL and then add the parameters.
To add multiple parameters, you have to seperate them with a `&`.

Like this:  
**Online:** _`https://dertyp7.github.io/ts5-obs-overlay/?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2`_  
**Offline:** _`file://C:/Users/.../ts5-overlay-{version}.html?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2`_

Real example:  
**Online:** _`https://dertyp7.github.io/ts5-obs-overlay/?remoteAppPort=5899&hideNonTalking=true&clientLimit=5&showChannelName=true`_  
**Offline:** _`file://C:/Users/.../ts5-overlay-{version}.html?remoteAppPort=5899&hideNonTalking=true&clientLimit=5&showChannelName=true`_

This is a **list** of **all available parameters** (all parameters are optional):

| Parameter         | Description                              | Type    | Default         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `remoteAppPort`   | The port of the Teamspeak 5 remote app   | number  | `5899`          |
| `hideNonTalking`  | Hide all non-talking clients             | boolean | `false`         |
| `clientLimit`     | Count of how many client should be shown | number  | `0` (unlimited) |
| `showChannelName` | Display the channel name                 | boolean | `false`         |

## Setup (Developer)

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. To start the development server run `npm run dev`

## Common Issues

### The overlay is empty, but i'm connected to a Teamspeak 5 server

Sadly TeamSpeak5 does not give us any information about the current active server tab.  
So we try currently use a workaround, where the active server tab is determined by looking on which server the your hardware input was unmuted the latest, since the non-active server tabs in TS5 usually mute the clientâ€™s microphone.

However this workaround is not 100% accurate and can fail in some cases.

Possible fixes:

- Unmute and mute yourself in the active server tab (Just a normal unmute and mute, not the hardware mute)
- Reconnect to the TS5 server while the overlay is open

### OBS doesn't show the latest version of the overlay

This can happen if the OBS Browser Source is caching the overlay.  
To prevent this, open the Browser Source settings and click on "Refresh cache of current page".
