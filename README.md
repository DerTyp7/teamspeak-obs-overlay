# Teamspeak5-OBS-Overlay

This is an overlay for OBS to show the current talking clients in your Teamspeak 5 Channel.  
This App uses the new "Remote Apps" feature of Teamspeak 5.

This overlay uses the [Teamspeak 5 Remote App API](https://github.com/DerTyp7/react-ts5-remote-app-api).

### Adding Parameters

Start by adding a `?` to the end of the URL and then add the parameters.
To add multiple parameters, you have to seperate them with a `&`.

Like this:  
**Online:** _`https://dertyp7.github.io/ts5-obs-overlay/?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2`_  
**Offline:** _`file://C:/Users/.../ts5-overlay-{version}.html?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2`_

Real example:  
**Online:** _`https://dertyp7.github.io/ts5-obs-overlay/?remoteAppPort=5899&hideNonTalking=true&clientLimit=5&showChannelName=true`_  
**Offline:** _`file://C:/Users/.../ts5-overlay-{version}.html?remoteAppPort=5899&hideNonTalking=true&clientLimit=5&showChannelName=true`_

This is a **list** of **all available parameters** (all parameters are optional):

| Parameter         | Description                              | Type    | Default         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `remoteAppPort`   | The port of the Teamspeak 5 remote app   | number  | `5899`          |
| `hideNonTalking`  | Hide all non-talking clients             | boolean | `false`         |
| `clientLimit`     | Count of how many client should be shown | number  | `0` (unlimited) |
| `showChannelName` | Display the channel name                 | boolean | `false`         |

## Setup (Developer)

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. To start the development server run `npm run dev`

## Common Issues

### The overlay is empty, but i'm connected to a Teamspeak 5 server

Sadly TeamSpeak5 does not give us any information about the current active server tab.  
So we try currently use a workaround, where the active server tab is determined by looking on which server the your hardware input was unmuted the latest, since the non-active server tabs in TS5 usually mute the clientâ€™s microphone.

However this workaround is not 100% accurate and can fail in some cases.

Possible fixes:

- Unmute and mute yourself in the active server tab (Just a normal unmute and mute, not the hardware mute)
- Reconnect to the TS5 server while the overlay is open
